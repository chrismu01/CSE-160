    NOTES TO GRADERS<br>
    I have two textures, corn for the wall and dirt for the ground.<br>
    The sky is made of a blue cube<br>
    The game of this world is to navigate through the cornmaze to collect your corn on the cob at the end.<br>
    Animals are placed along the way as indicators you are going in the right way to the goal
